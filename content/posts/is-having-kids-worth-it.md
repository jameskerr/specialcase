I've had a few conversations recently where people want to know if having kids is worth it. These friends are usually in a place where they are considering starting a family.

I love talking about kids. I probably talk too much about them. Parenting is facinating. The things our culture teaches us vs our parents vs our church. Every has opinions on how to raise kids.

But they want to hear about how hard it is. It usually goes something like, it's so hard but it's worth it. That just doesn't cut it for people. They do not seem comforted by that statement. I was not before kids. There are so many things that are simply impossible to understand before having a child. There is such nuance in that statement above. Everytime I have these conversations, I feel discouraged because I have not convinced them that it's worth it. They still don't believe me. I personally enjoy my children. I even enjoy the misery to some degree. Misery starts when the struggle ends. You and your partner can become closer by being in a shared struggle. 

But I'm learning to respect people who don't have kids too. And choose not to. There really is something about choosing not to do it. It takes courage to not do what most people do. It also takes courage to do what most people do. 

There is no one way to live your life. I, like all of us, usually give advice that goes something like, "do everything exactly like I did and think everything I think so that I feel more confident in my own life choices." Haha all advice is just people trying to get you to live like they did.

I am so tempted to go this route when people as me about kids. Was it worth it for me? Yes. Will it be worth it for you? Probably, but you'll never know until you do, and at that point there is no going back. I guess, if you are pondering the question "is it worth it", you will have no solid answer until you actually do.

The one thing that suprised me about having my first child was that it was not an "abstract baby". Not abstract like, "do you want kids?" Who are those hypothetical kids. I don't know them. But when my first baby entered the world, I was suprised that it was **my** baby. Whoa, it looks like me and my wife. There is no other baby in the world exactly like it. Therefore, there is no other person who will feel the way I do about this person. Our link is unique. 

That's something you can't tell someone about. You don't know "their" baby. You only know yours.

I get embarssed when I go from sharing my experience to trying to get someone on board with having kids. Trying to convince them to do it. I don't like the feeling, because it's impossible for me to convince someone. I'll just ask people if they have specific questions in the future. Is there something you'd like to know about my experience with kids which may be much different than yours? I feel like I'm trying to sell someone on an experience that they can't ever fully understand until they jump in and do it themselves. It is refreshing to talk about kids to people who have kids. They know. I don't want to be insensitve to people without kids by saying how rosey and wonderful it is, and I don't want to talk crap about my kids too much to people without kids because they just cannot understand the sublty between "my kids a devil" and "my kids an angel". People just don't know what it's like to simultaneously hate and love something so much.

Is it worth it to have kids? For me, yes. If you know for certain, then no. If you're curious, then probably.

You'll never understand the "worth it" part. And they'll never unstand the "is so much work" part.
