title: My Personal Computer README
---



Here's an idea. A README document for your own personal computer. ~/README.md for instance. I am always asking myself, "how did I install go?" Through homebrew or from the website? How do I update this or that. Where did I save that liecnese? Where do I put cool voicemails that I want to save? What goes on iCloud vs what stays local. 



These are all things that I had at one point decided, but usually forget. 



I just got a new work computer and I'm going to make a ~/README in my home folder that has answers to all these questions. Every piece of software I install will get logged in there along with how I installed it and maybe the link to upgrade it when the time comes.

It also contains the rules for folders and guides on where things live.

Next time I setup a computer, I'll have peace knowing where things are.
