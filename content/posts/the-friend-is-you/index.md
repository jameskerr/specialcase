Imagine hanging out with someone all day who berates you. They make final judgements about your character. They criticize anything you do imperfectly. They even even criticize you for having such a shitty friend around you all the time. You desperately wish to they would go away, but they keep following you. They never leave you. The moment you wake up until the moment you fall asleep. Every conscious moment, you are forced to hear their stream of negative comments flowing into your ear.

What would you do?

You would escape.

You'd always want people around so at least there are some other voices in the room. And when you are inevitably alone, you would alter your state to shut them out for a few moments. Solitude is abusive.

Now imagine a true best friend. They arrive the moment you arise. This friend knows everything you've ever done, good and bad. They know. They care. They love you. All day, they listen to you. They never make a final judgement. They say things that encourage you to live into higher and higher versions of yourself. They fully accept where you're at today and they understand the difficult moments you'll feel as you grow. They are fascinated by your unique personality. They don't gossip about other people to you. In fact, they see everyone like this. Even your enemies. But they're only best friends with you. Loyal. Consistent.

What would you do?

The sky's the limit. Solitude is no longer scary, it is grounding.

We don't get to choose many things, but we get to choose our friends.
