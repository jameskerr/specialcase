Experiences compress into memories.  
Memories compress into feelings.  
Feelings compress into instincts.  
Instincts compress into the unconscious.  
The unconscious compresses into the collective human unconscious.  

There's an analogy in software. When you make a song in music software, you start with big uncompressed files. All the sound layers are stored separately. When the song is finished, it gets flattened into one layer resulting in the same sounds, but a smaller file size.  We can then compress that file even more with general compression algorithms. Finally, it can be uploaded to the cloud and streamed to millions of others without having to take up any of their disk space. 

Maybe thatâ€™s how the immesurable data from billions of experiences get mysteriously persisted into our human nature.
