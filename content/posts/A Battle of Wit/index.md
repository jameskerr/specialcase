Swords drawn, Draw blood, Blood in the water

Recover, Respond, Respect

Cross the line, Cut too deep, Feel the heat

Reach out a hand, Pull up to stand

Love wrapped up in a sheath

This was written on a backpacking trip where eight men hiked for four days in the wilderness. Whenever a group of friends are together, you're bound to find this battlefield.
