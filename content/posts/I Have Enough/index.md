---

*I have enough food in my kitchen.*

*I have enough water to drink.*

*I have enough clothes to wear.*

*I have enough things in my house.*

*I have enough skill to work.*

*I have enough ideas to think.*

*I have enough people that love me.*

*I have enough people to love.*

*I have enough people to talk to.*

*I have enough people to laugh with.*

*I have enough time to relax.*

*I have enough life to experience.*

*I have enough.*

*Enough.*

A quote from my from my pastor last week at church has been rolling around in my head all this week.

> Money is a useful tool for moving things around, so that everyone can have what they need.

It made me think of "everything I need." Truth is, I have too many things. I don't want more things around me. Yet, I always wish I had more money. For what? I was then inspired to think of all the ways I have enough and write it up in a poem. 

What a liberating thing to realize.
