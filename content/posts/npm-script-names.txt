A new developer's experience should always be:

```
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
yarn
yarn start
```

Your CI should workflow should always be:

```
yarn build
yarn lint
yarn test
```

If your build process can't all fit in a single script, use `npm-run-all`. Make a series of helper scripts prefixed by one perfect four above.

```
{
  "build": "npm-run-all -s build:library build:demo",
  "build:library": "yarn workspace library build",
  "build:demo": "yarn workspace demo build",
}
```

Let me define each one.

1. **Start**

This is the first thing a new user would do to start your package. For some, this starts the development experience. For others, this starts a server. Don't use `dev`, don't use `watch`, use `start`.

2. **build**

Builds the production version of your package and puts it in the `/dist`. Folder (only use `dist` and `src`).

3. **lint**

Lint the code with a static analyzer. Check types, check format, check style. All that goes in this one.

4. **test**

Run all of the tests. If this package contains multiple types of tests (unit, integration), please run them all sequentially. New developers of your package can easily know that if `yarn test` passes, we're good to go.

Side note, put your e2e tests in another package using yarn's monorepo setup. Then the e2e tests have their own package with their own test script.
