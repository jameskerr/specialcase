What if we didn't think of God as infinite.

What if God poured itself into this _particular_ universe. What if He's completely bound to this one cosmos. It's life is _it's_ life. Our "being" is only because the Source is fully giving itself to the existence.

If we think this way, God is embedded into the material around us. He's not a distant cosmic scientist creating life in his lab, doing experiments, always able to try again, no one instance too important.

What if this is the only finite instance! God has gone all in, nothing saved for a backup plan, fully committed.

Thinking like this helps me want to love God and my existence. Maybe God risked everything for this one universe. There is no Plan B. If things go wrong, there is no do-over; only repair, forgiveness, recovery, and mercy.
