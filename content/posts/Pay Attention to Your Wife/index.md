At the end of Jordan Petersen’s *12 Rules of Life*, there’s a story about an aimless young man. He’s wandering around with no direction and stumbles upon Petersen’s book. Something awakens within him. He gets a job as a dishwasher and decides to do it well. He decides it’s important to do this crappy job well.  He decides to take his work seriously.

A dishwasher is not a glamorous occupation. It’s not highly sought or even very challenging. But the young man gave himself over to it. He didn’t judge it as beneath him. Instead, he cast a vote for being the type of person that does things well.

A little over 5 years ago, I took a job as a husband. Many would say that being a partner in a marriage is more dignified and highly sought than a dishwashing job. For whatever reason, when I read that story, I started thinking, "If this young man can take his job seriously, what would it mean  to take my job as a husband seriously?" Two words came to mind. 

**Pay attention.**

It surprised me how fast they came to me.

At this stage of knowing someone, it’s not hard to find the many ways they are not perfect. It’s easy to focus on the difficulties of marriage and the shortcomings of my wife and judge this job not worthy of the serious effort it takes to do well. Just as that kid could have rattled off the many hassles of washing dishes, he decided to take it seriously anyway. But he decided he would do his best no matter the job. It reminds me of the pure form of love where the love requires nothing of the beloved. Love simple for the reward of loving. Divine behavior.

The story ends there and it struck me. How you do anything is how you do everything. 

So I want to pay attention to my wife. I want to take my job as a husband seriously, which is so much more glorious than a dishwasher. 

I started doing the best I could. I stopped and listened to every word she said to me. I would listen and repeat back to her what she said. I would not jump to agree or disagree. I would not feel responsible for resolving her issues. I would only pay attention to what she was saying. Understand it, then let her know in some way I had received it.

The results are incredible. We are happier. She was surprised at first, thinking that I was going to expect something in return for all the attention I was giving. She feared it was only a matter of days before I would get resentful and angry. But that is the power of doing something for yourself. It doesn’t matter what other people do. You require nobody to change. It is freedom.

I don’t do this all the time. Especially if I’m tired. But it’s a good montra. Pay attention. Very Jordan Petersen. It sounds like a title of one of his chapters. It also is part of his rule, pay attention to what people say like they have something you need to know. It’s full of curiosity and humility. It’s fuel for love.
