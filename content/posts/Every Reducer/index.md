I was so inspired by Layout Primitives in the Every Layout website. And I work on writing reducers in Redux alot. I thought, what is the equivalent of the every reducer. Giving names to these reducer primitives that we often use in apps would be awesome.

## The Key Value Reducer

## The CRUD Reducer

## The Combined Reducer

## The Active Item Reducer
