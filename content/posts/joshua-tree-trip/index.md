We took a trip down to Joshua Tree this weekend for a cousin's wedding. For the first time, I could appreciate the gifts of a desert climate. There is much less visual input stimulating the brain. The plants don't grow dense or tall so you can see everything around you. It's calming not to wonder what's behind the trees. And the heat makes you want to just sleep or sit in the pool or not do anything. If you need to rest or think, the dessert is a great place to do it.

Here's Caleb cracking him self up as he spits his water out of his mouth. Spitting is hilarious to the 3-year-old male.

Phoebe's stunning blue eyes.

Outside the pizza place we visited, [Sky High Pie](https://www.clover.com/online-ordering/sky-high-pie). Very good crust. The kids always get cheese with pineapple.

When they stand close to each other the pictures are double cute. This is my new phone background ☝️.

We drove to the  [Hi-View Trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hi-View+Trailhead/@34.0760208,-116.4018785,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dad8be48859b39:0x8d3f1e64616c0b2f!8m2!3d34.0760208!4d-116.3993036!16s%2Fg%2F1q5bn9ppl?entry=ttu) outside of Yucca Valley and walked about 100 feet down the path from the parking lot before turning back. Short, sweet and hot. But long enough to take some great photos of the Joshua Trees.

Later that day we left the kids with Papa and headed to the wedding. Vanessa and Sarah put the final touches on the wedding cake which traveled all the way from San Francisco.

Tasted delicious.

The next day we stopped by Hemet, CA to visit Grammy and Hilmer. My mom and Bill stopped by too.

Hilmer fired up the 1940s era bulldozer that was in full working order. Caleb was stoked. He was also scared once the engine started. "Too loud!" But he and Phoebe rode that bad boy and I told them they were brave.

My favorite picture of the weekend. There is symbolism here that I can't fully put words to. The great-grandmother with her cane, leaning the on the powerful machine of the past, looking down at the toddlers who carry the future. Just beautiful.

Out final night was spent with my good friend Ryan at his house in Corona. I've been visiting that house for the past 10 years. As a single man, a married man, and now a father. It's a special place of retreat for me. Caleb and Phoebe learned all about the Starship Enterprise. They later asked me to drive the car "warp speed."

Caleb prefers riding, and Phoebe prefers pushing. She'll push that wagon through the entire airport. And DO NOT try to take her away from her pushing.

It's always exhausting, but traveling with this family is getting pretty fun.
