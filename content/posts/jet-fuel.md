We build an engine for it.  
It propels us to new heights.  
It explodes.  
It destroys everything around it.  
It takes us to heavenly places.  
It burns.  
It brings us to life.  
It transcends the earth.  
Handle with care.  
Enjoy its power.  
Summon it for good.  
Rest in the potential within.  
Sacred energy.  
For purpose.  
For pleasure.  
For life.
