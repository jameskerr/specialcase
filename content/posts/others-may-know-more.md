description: A child relies on caregivers to teach her who she is. For a time, they know more about her than she does.

A child knows nothing about itself. Its body is a mystery, its ideas, its dreams, its feelings.  The child relies on caregivers to teach her everything. The caregivers know more about who she is than she does.

Does this ever stop? Do any of us ever fully know who we are? No matter what age I am, will there be others who know more about me than I do?

Maybe not me as James, but me as human being. Me as human spirit.

I cannot assume that I know everything about what it means to be human and I must assume that others or God or scriptures can know more.

What a humbling thought: _Others may know more about me than I do._
