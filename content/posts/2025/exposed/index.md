Yesterday, I got my first conference talk proposal rejection. It was going to be about folder structures, so I’m guessing there wasn’t enough AI to make the final cut.

When I got the email, I felt both disappointed and relieved. It would have been a thrill to speak but I don’t have a ton of time and I love focusing on my main project [Tend Cash](https://tend.cash).

In that arena, I was also rejected yesterday! Right after the kids went to bed, a user signed up, spent about 15 minutes scheduling her expenses, linked a bank, and then deleted her account. She responded to my intro email saying it wasn’t what she was looking for.

As I was falling asleep, the feeling I had was like being out in the open sea without a sail. Like being in an open field with nowhere to hide from the enemy at the tree line. It was a vulnerable feeling. I was exposed.

Then I remembered the common phrase: “put yourself out there.” It did feel like I was “out there” wherever “there” was. And that is exactly where I want to be! I want to speak at conferences and sell my own software and post my own articles.

So today, I’m encouraged. If my goal is to put myself out there, it's a good sign to feel exposed.
